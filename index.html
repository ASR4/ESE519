<p>You’re watching a movie, and suddenly there’s an explosion. The screen flashes, the speakers boom, and you feel the shockwave hit your chest.  Except you cannot feel the shockwave, because your home theater only has speakers and a TV, which cannot replicate this sensation.  With the invention of so called “4D” experiences, adding smells, water mists and other cheap tricks to enhance your viewing experience of some film, theme parks have been able to thrill many of their customers, but you’re no closer to having this experience in your home.  

Our project will be able to enhance the viewing experience of normal video content that has a closed caption description.  We will take the closed captions and provide a personal touch and feel to each video that is played through our system.</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Media Immersive Simulator</h3>

<p><h4>Our System</h4>
The system will attempt to replicate several sensations that are common to many videos.  Our first prototype will consist of an arm sleeve that will go on your arm and give you different sensations through a series of vibrators.  Next, we will pair these sensations with a video and time them to occur at certain points.  And finally, we will have a compressed air vest that will mimic these sensations and additional sensations.

The software system will compose of an application running on a pc with a video player, which will feed the commands to an mbed device that will control the actuation of the sleeve or vest.

The hardware for the sleeve will consist of some strips of fabric that have vibrators attached.  The active part of the vest will be made from silicon and have air channels which will be sectioned off to create zones for compression and vibration.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Trials</h3>

<p>
The system will be tested with a set of videos and pre-programmed action sequences.  These sequences in a real system would be read from a closed caption file and parsed into actions real time during the video playback.  The success of the system in our trials will be a realistic sensation that occurs at the time that is commanded by the pc controller.</p>

<a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Demo/h3>

<p>We plan to demo at least 3 real sensations paired up with 5 videos.  If we succeed in accomplishing our goal, we will attempt to simulate an additional 2 sensations and an additional 3 videos.</p>
